author: Eleni Nisioti
author_bio: I am a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="https://developmentalsystems.org/">Flowers, Inria</a> working on learning in 
  multi-agent systems. I like analyzing how environments and group properties create challenges and opportunities for agents adapting individually and collectively. What this means in practice is that I
  I train agents with reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms and design environments with dynamics inspired from ecological studies.
  
  You can see my recent publications <a href="/publications"> here</a>.

  I also like fiction, especially science fiction inspired from ideas in complex systems. <a href="/fiction"> Here </a> are some of my short stories.
